		<p style="font-size:19px">At GB Window Cleaning, our goal is to make each and every home and business owner’s day a
			little brighter, but especially in these uncertain and stressful times. We are monitoring
			updates from the Centers for Disease Control
			 and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in response to the public health
			  situation related to coronavirus (COVID-19). The safety and health of our commercial and
				residential customers, franchisees, their employees, and our communities is paramount to us.
</p>

<p style="font-size:19px"><b>We are taking care of our team and increasing our preventative measures by encouraging employees to:</b></p>
<ul style="font-size:18px">
<li>Wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li>
<li>Use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available</li>
<li>Avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands</li>
 <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
<li>Put distance between themselves and other people</li>
<li>Stay home if feeling sick</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect window cleaning equipment and office equipment before use</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:18px">GB Window Cleaning's custom solution has properties that make it a great disinfectant. In fact, it has been found to “dissolve the lipid envelope of the virus, thereby inactivating it.”
we are currently offering a pre spray on windows (inside and outside) that will disenfect the glass.
<br>
<br>
We always wear shoe covers while in a customer’s home to not only protect their floors but to also avoid bringing in any germs or bacteria. We will continue this practice as usual.
<br>
<br>
Our towels are being laundered using the warmest appropriate water setting and being dried completely, in accordance with the recommendations from the CDC.
<br>
